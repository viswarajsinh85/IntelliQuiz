2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**:
   The database will be automatically initialized when you run the application for the first time.

6. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key for session security
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` & `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Credentials for the admin user (auto-created on first run)
